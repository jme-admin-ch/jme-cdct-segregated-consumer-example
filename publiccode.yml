    shortDescription: jEAP microservice example demonstrating consumer-driven contract testing with Pacts in a consumer (two API of same provider).
    longDescription: >
      This project demonstrates consumer-driven contract testing with segregated APIs in a Java-based microservice
      architecture. The provider service exposes two separate APIs, each configured with its own dedicated Pact provider for
      independent contract verification.
      The example includes automated verification tests that retrieve all relevant consumer contracts from a Pact Broker, 
      validate them against the provider's implementation, and publish the verification results back to the broker. 
      This ensures the provider fulfills all consumer expectations and maintains contract compliance across both APIs.
    features:
      - Runs pact consumer tests
      - Generates pacts
      - Publishes pacts to a Pact Broker
